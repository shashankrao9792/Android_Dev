Sort your ideas for activities into top-level activities, category activities, and detail/edit activities. Use the category activities to navigate from the top-level activities to the detail/edit activities.                                                                                                                                                                  
A list view displays items in a list. Add it to your layout using the <ListView> element.                                                                                                
Use android:entries in your layout to populate the items in your list views from an array defined in strings.xml.                                                                        
An adapter acts as a bridge between an AdapterView and a data source. ListViews and Spinners are both types of AdapterView.                                                              
An ArrayAdapter is an adapter that works with arrays.                                                                                                                                    
Handle click events on Buttons using android:onClick in the layout code. Handle click events elsewhere by creating a listener and implementing its click event.
